### install and get started:
1. leap only need repo for openQA, perl module repo is not manditory
2. old version zypper won't refresh repo data automatically --- package version conflict
3. /etc/openqa/client.conf should be created for store key and pass  
4. pool should be owned by _openqa-worker
5. step should be: openqa and worker been installed; then fetch needle; have the template as configuration file; run client script to create job


### question:
1. how should the loaded configuration been delete---> db file be delete and init again
2. add configuration from web---> variables settings could refer to the templates file
3. meaning for all of the variables when run the client script...---> used to specific the test job
4. db init forcely---> db file remove and then use command: initdb --prepare_init --force and initdb --init_database --force ---> restart openqa-webui and apache2 service
5. cancel the queued jobs---> not sure about command line method yet
?5. the job will repeat automatically
6. needles for enterprise version(SLED and SLES share the same) could be found in gitlab
7. opensuse and enterprise version share the same folder 'lib' 'script' 'test', use the main.pm file to determine which DISTRO is running: and stored in the separate folder /var/lib/openqa/tests/sle
8. content for directory pool/x, durint testing, files will be stored here, when test is done the files in this folder will be moved to testresult folder for track


### tips:
1. perl /usr/share/openqa/script/client isos post ISO=openSUSE-13.2-DVD-x86_64.iso DISTRI=opensuse VERSION=13.2 FLAVOR=DVD ARCH=x86_64 BUILD=GM
2. FLAVOR means the iso type


### testing process:
1. each screenshot was created by the assert/check(green) or save(gray) screen
2. default ticked tag was the ones included in the used needles
3.  


### further:
1. sudo -u _openqa-worker /var/lib/openqa/script/worker --instance x: permission deny
2. VARIABLES like HDD: scenario try
3. when fail, use INTERACTIVE mode TO WORKAROUND
