### install and get started:
1. opensuse leap only need repo for openQA, perl module repo is not manditory
2. old version zypper won't refresh repo data automatically ---> package version conflict
3. pool should be owned by _openqa-worker
4. played steps: openqa and worker been installed; then fetchneedle; have the template as configuration file; run client script to create job


### question:
1. how should the loaded configuration been delete---> db file be delete and init again
2. add configuration from web---> refer to the templates file for variables settings 
3. variables added when run the client script...---> used to uniquely specify the test job
4. db init forcely---> db file remove and then use command: initdb --prepare_init --force and initdb --init_database --force ---> restart openqa-webui and apache2 service
5. cancel the queued jobs---> not sure about command line method yet
6. needles for enterprise version(SLED and SLES share the same) could be found in gitlab
7. content for directory pool/x: durint testing, files were temproryly stored here, when test is done files in this folder will be moved to testresult folder 


### tips:
1. launch example: perl /usr/share/openqa/script/client isos post ISO=openSUSE-13.2-DVD-x86_64.iso DISTRI=opensuse VERSION=13.2 FLAVOR=DVD ARCH=x86_64 BUILD=GM
2. FLAVOR means the iso type


### during test:
1. each screenshot was created by the assert/check(green) or save(gray) screen
2. default ticked tag was the ones included in the used needles
3.  


### further:
1. sudo -u _openqa-worker /var/lib/openqa/script/worker --instance x: permission deny
2. VARIABLES like HDD: scenario try
3. when fail, use INTERACTIVE mode TO WORKAROUND
